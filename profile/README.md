## 🎯 Motivation
The **Balearic Biodiversity Centre** (CBB), as part of the University of the Balearic Islands' commitment to excellence in research and scientific-technical infrastructures, is an initiative aimed at generating knowledge about the biological diversity and natural environments of the Balearic archipelago. This information is crucial for establishing management and conservation policies and for maintaining the ecosystem services that biodiversity provides to society and human well-being.


## ✨ General Objectives
The main objective of the **CBB** is to strengthen the potential and capacity of the region's scientific community by generating knowledge, collaborations, and synergies. The Centere is equipped with state-of-the-art technology for morphological, genetic, and genomic studies. The **CBB** hosts natural history collections that aim to preserve biological specimens, biodiversity records, and ecological data for research, education, and long-term conservation efforts. Additionally, the Centere has specialized personnel and a computing facility dedicated to advanced statistical and bioinformatic analyses in order to address several aspects of studying and protecting Balearic biodiversity.


## 📁 GitHub Repository
The **CBB** has a repository on GitHub, where the code for scientific publications, research projects, and tools developed within its studies will be shared.

This repository will serve as an open resource to promote transparency, reuse, and collaboration in the field of biodiversity. Researchers, environmental managers, and developers will be able to access the available tools, contribute to improvements, and adapt the material to new scientific and technical needs.

Additionally, the repository will facilitate the dissemination of the knowledge generated at the Centere, ensuring that its advancements are accessible to the scientific community, governmental institutions, and the general public. This, in turn, will promote the development of more effective strategies for biodiversity conservation in the Balearic Islands.
